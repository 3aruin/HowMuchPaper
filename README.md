## HowMuchPaper
Old School Copier needs more paper before they running out!

With a fleet of printers always buying paper is a pain.
The goal is to get to know how much paper you need. 


## How to Run the Code: DON'T
Ensure you have the wolframalpha Python package installed:

      pip install wolframalpha

Replace YOUR_APP_ID with your actual WolframAlpha API key.
Run the script, and it will output the required number of cases of paper based on the number of working days.


## Goals

The aim is to find out the Monday - Friday paper use based on numbers reported by printers

      As this information can be found in many ways will build to meet my needs but also to just work*
      
            Ideally being able to pull from SNMP and get rolling number would be great
            
            But know the buffer
                  * How does it take to get more paper
                  * How much does need shif in a year
